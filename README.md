# NodeJS Typescript Template

A template for a typescript nodejs application.

The template uses nodemon and ts-node to continously watch your file during development.

The template has the following commands:
    - npm install (to install all dependencies)
    - npm run dev or nodemon (for development)
    - npm build (to transpile the application into js)
    - npm start (to run in production)
